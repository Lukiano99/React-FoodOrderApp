# Food Order App
This is an application for online food ordering. It's extremely intuitive,
so there's no need to explain its functionality. The essence lies in clean code
and the tools I used for implementation. Everything is organized through
React Context, custom hooks are utilized, and conditional HTML elements
are in play. Each component doesn't have a lot of code; they are concise
and well-structured. It's worth taking a look at the code. Enjoy!
